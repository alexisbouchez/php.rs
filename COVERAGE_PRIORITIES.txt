========================================
Updated: 2026-02-14
Current: 2225/2231 functions (99.7%)

All 50 extensions now have 100% function coverage.
Remaining 6 uncounted functions are false positives from the coverage parser.

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS — CORRECTNESS & DEPTH
================================================================================

Function stubs are in place but many are shallow implementations. Priority
areas for deepening correctness:

 1. [DONE] CALLBACK SUPPORT — invoke_user_callback helper added to VM.
    call_user_func, call_user_func_array, array_map, array_filter,
    array_reduce, array_walk, usort, uasort, uksort all invoke real
    user-defined functions and closures. preg_replace_callback still a stub.

 2. FILE I/O — fopen/fread/fwrite/fclose work via FileHandle but resource
    tracking is basic. Streams, contexts, and wrappers are stubs.

 3. REGEX — pcre functions use Rust's regex crate, not PCRE2. Some patterns
    (backreferences, lookbehind, Unicode properties) may differ.

 4. DATE/TIME — strtotime handles basic formats but complex relative dates
    and timezone transitions are incomplete.

 5. [DONE] CRYPTO — hash/hash_hmac now support md5, sha1, sha256, sha384,
    sha512 via php-rs-ext-hash. HMAC uses proper RFC 2104 implementation.
    hash_equals is timing-safe. openssl/sodium still stubs.

 6. DATABASE — All mysqli/pgsql/odbc functions are stubs returning false/0.
    Real database connectivity requires actual driver integration.

 7. INTL — All 187 intl functions are stubs returning false. Real ICU
    integration would require binding to libicu or a Rust equivalent.

 8. GD — All 108 image functions are stubs. Real image processing would
    require an image library like the `image` crate.

 9. [DONE] COMPRESSION — gzcompress/gzencode/gzdeflate now use flate2 for
    real DEFLATE compression. All roundtrip correctly. zlib_encode/zlib_decode
    also wired up.

10. NETWORK — curl_exec uses real HTTP via ureq. curl_init/setopt/exec/getinfo/errno/error/close
    all work end-to-end with real networking. [DONE]
